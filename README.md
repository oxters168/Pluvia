## Features

Pluvia is still in active early development, so some features may be lacking or not working correctly.</br>
Pluvia currently provides these features:

- View and download games through the app.
- *Play (DRM free) games using [MiceWine ](https://github.com/KreitinnSoftware/MiceWine-Application) built into the app.
- Configure the game containers to use different options to improve the performance of each game.
- Steam Cloud integration for your cloud saves, allowing you to resume where you left off.
- View your friends list. (Note: chat and friend management in the works too)

&ast; Existing issues or limitations that occur with the actual MiceWine app will mostly apply here when running a game.

See the [Wiki](https://github.com/oxters168/Pluvia/wiki) for more information.


See the [compatibility repo](https://github.com/oxters168/PluviaCompat) to check if your game runs.
